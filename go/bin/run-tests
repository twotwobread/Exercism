# This test suite:
# (1) moves all go files (and modules) into a tmp directory,
# (2) overwrites the stub with the exemplar solution
# (3) runs the various linters
# (4) runs the tests
# (5) then deletes the tmp directory.

# We use this instead of build constraints to have less noise in stub files.
# Newcomers to go might be confused by build constraints

# We copy everything into a test directory rather than doing this in the actual
# directories to simplify cleanup and make it far less likely that we will
# accidentally commit an unintended change to the source files.
# One downside to this is that the errors generated reference the temporary
# file locations rather than the real ones, but we deemed this cost acceptable.
